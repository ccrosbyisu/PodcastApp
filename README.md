# PodcastApp
Podcast app made in React-Native as a final project for my cloud computing course

Development Enviornment Setup(React Native CLI Quickstart):

note: on Mac you can install dependencies with homebrew or NPM (I personally used NPM)
https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

IOS:

If XCode gives Buildtime error: Unable to load contents of file list:
1.	Open terminal under project folder (ios folder)
2.	pod deintegrate
3.	npm install cocoapods
4.	Open the project and delete (if it's still there) the “Pods” folder that should be red
5.	pod setup (This may take some time)
6.	pod install


Android:
1. Open directory on project folder in terminal and run npm install
2. Run npx react-native run-android
3. Android Studio’s simulator should start up and begin to install the app
